# West Nile Virus Analysis & Prediction


## Executive Summary

West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US, and it is spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, specifically a Culex pipiens mosquito. One in five infected people with WNV would experience fever, nausea, headache and muscle aches lasting from a few days to a few weeks - while the remaining four out of five would not exhibit any symptoms. To date, the virus remains a major concern as individuals with weaker immune systems and those above 60 are at higher risk for severe illness from WNV - raking up medical costs and creating more burden in the healthcare system. 

Every year the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) runs a comprehensive surveillance program in suburban areas to trap mosquitoes and test them for WNV. This data has helped CDPH target high-risk areas for the virus and significantly reduce the number of positive cases in the last few years. ([source](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/healthy_communities/news/2022/september/first-human-case-of-west-nile-virus-detected-in-chicago-in-2022.html))

However in 2021, Chicago was ranked one of the top five US cities with mosquitoes - putting its residents at risk of contracting WNV. ([source](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-to-spray-insecticide-to-protect-against-west-nile-virus)). Furthermore in the last two years, much of the public efforts and funding were focused on keeping the city safe from COVID-19. Now, ahead of the looming recession and tightening of budgets ([source](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023)), the CDPH recognized an urgency to plan ahead and be prudent about spending. 

Our team at the Disease and Treatment Agency was tasked to analyze the years with more severe WNV outbreak and devise a plan to identify potential hotspots, ahead of the 2023 summer period.

**Our problem statement:**
To build a model with more than 70% recall to predict the period and location where mosquitoes will test positive for WNV, enabling CDPH to preemptively allocate the cityâ€™s spraying resources to curb the virus transmission.

## About the datasets

- [`train.csv`](../assets/train.csv): This is the main dataset we'll be working with, which contains 10,506 observations on the presence of West Nile Virus across neighborhood clusters in Chicago, Illinois. This dataset is taken from the years 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. There are a total of 11 variables involved in tracking the West Nile Virus in the neighborhoods.
- [`test.csv`](../assets/test.csv): There's a total of 11 features and 116,293 observations for the years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. The presence of West Nile Virus is missing from this set, which we will use our model to predict. 
- [`spray.csv`](../assets/spray.csv): This dataset contains 14,835 geographic information system (GIS) data on the city's spraying efforts in 2011 and 2013 - including the date, time, latitude and longitude.
-  [`weather.csv`](../assets/weather.csv): This dataset contains weather information from 2007 to 2014 - covering 2,944 observations across 22 relevant weather-related variables. 
- [`mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.txt`](../assets/mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.txt): Map files from Open Streetmap and used for visualizations in the analysis.

## Methodology

For this project, we've conducted a thorough analysis and modeling through these steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: We assessed the training dataset for any outliers and removed them immediately. We also checked for missing values where we've filled them or removed them if irrelevant.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We visualized the dataset through a series of graphs and plots to better understand the relationships between variables as well as its individual impact the spread of the West Nile Virus.
3. **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**: After evaluating specific variables, we removed variables that didn't have much impact and combined variables that were relevant to each other.
4. **Data Modeling & Evaluation**: Based on the selected features, we modeled them through these classification models - Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier and Adaptive Boosting Classifier. The best model will then be used to predict the presence of West Nile Virus in the test dataset. 
5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Following the best model selected, we also conducted a cost-benefit analysis on annual cost of pesticide coverage and its benefits - particularly for areas that are at higher risk.

We've also uploaded the predicted West Nile Virus presence on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-west-nile-virus/data) to measure the accuracy of our finalized model.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

We proposed three potential approach for spraying efforts, below is a summary:
- **Option 1: Spray all** 
    - Spraying all areas in Chicago limits us from identifying the regions with hot spots accurately after the operation completes. 
    - It's more harmful for the environment with the frequent spraying and may also irritate residents with sensitive skin and sense of smell
    - Even with this approach, there are still risks of positive cases so this approach will not guarantee that the city will be free of WNV - in fact, it could lead to the city wasting more resources. 
- **Option 2: No spray** 
    - When we choose not to spray at all, there is a much higher risk of people contracting WNV as it's one of the more widespread adult mosquito control measure. 
    - Hence this would lead to higher hospitalization cost and productivity loss - our analysis shows that the city risks losing up to USD5,681,655. 
- **Option 3: Targeted spray** 
    - This appears to be the best approach as it's the lowest in spraying cost. 
    - This helps minimize environmental impact from spraying and also reduce harm to the residents.
    - Furthermore, this approach demonstrate the benefits in cost savings of **USD440,459** for spray, when compared to Option 1

Hence, we would recommend pursuing the targeted spraying approach:
- USD766,280 in total cost for spraying as well as medical costs and productivity loss
- USD440,459 in cost savings for spray
- While there are still a few human cases, but knowing this now will help us prepare for severe illnesses ahead of time

## Limitations

There were several limitations in the model's ability to predict or classify the presence of WNV, including:

**1. Data availability and quality**:
- The classifier model need to rely on large amounts of high-quality data to make accurate predictions. There is insufficient data regarding spraying, as 2011 and 2013 datasets was the only spray data recorded. Data such as bird cases and human cases are also additional indicators that can be used to better detect WNV presence in areas around Chicago.
- For this project, the full effectiveness of the spray had to be predicted via feature engineering and the use of proxies to forecast subsequent years. 

**2. Limited generalizability**:
- The current model is trained on a specific dataset and may not be able to generalize to other datasets or situations. This can be a particular issue when trying to predict WNV infection, as the distribution of WNV cases can vary significantly from state to state.

## Conclusion

In summary, our model was able to:
1. Achieve target recall more than 70%: Model's recall is 72% through the Adaptive Boosting Classifier 
2. This allowed us to optimize a targeted spraying approach to save **USD440,459** in spraying efforts

## Recommendations

Through our model and proposed targeted approach, CDPH will be able to optimize spray in terms of frequency and locations to reduce the amount of unnecessary spraying in areas where WNV is absent. Sprays should also be done when there is low wind speeds to prevent the spray from blowing away too quickly.

However on top of our model, controlling mosquito population and curbing virus transmission will require a holistic approach. This could be done in a few ways:
1. **Larviciding**: As spraying only kills off adult mosquitoes, larvicides can help aid in killing mosquito larvae before they grow into adults, helping reduce the overall population.  
2. **Repellents**: Distribute insect repellents to the general public will encourage individuals to keep their homes and household safe from mosquitoes.   
3. **Mosquito repellent screens**: These should also be installed in prime areas such as public schools or event spaces to reduce the amount of mosquitoes from entering buildings. To further support community-wide mosquito control efforts, mosquito nets can be given to locals as well. 
4. **Educational campaigns at schools**: During the summer, most American students spend a lot of time at home and can chip in to help their parents keep their houses tidy. CDPH could consider running awareness workshops at schools in the spring time, to encourage students to keep their homes clean during the summertime.
5. **Increase frequency of trash collection**: Increase frequency of trash collection where disposables such as cups and containers are thrown away more often, particularly in open areas such as parks and outdoor malls. This would help prevent creating ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. 
6. **Creating alerts in neighborhoods**: Similar to how Singapore keep residents informed of dengue cases, Chicago neighborhoods can consider alerting local residents whenever WNV is detected. This can be done with a flyer on notice board or text alert that indicates active WNV virus in the community. 

The quest to improve the recall and accuracy of our WNV virus detection model is an ongoing one, which we can achieve by:
1. Keeping closer track of spray data from the last few years.
2. Including other variables, such as human cases and dead bird cases.
3. Using local neighborhood's weather data for higher location accuracy.
