    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We visualized the dataset through a series of graphs and plots to better understand the relationships between variables as well as its individual impact the spread of the West Nile Virus.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**: After evaluating specific variables, we removed variables that didn't have much impact and combined variables that were relevant to each other.\n",
    "4. **Data Modeling & Evaluation**: Based on the selected features, we modeled them through these classification models - **XXX**. The best model will then be used to predict the presence of West Nile Virus in the test dataset. \n",
