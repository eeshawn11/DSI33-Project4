    "## Executive Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US, and it is spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, specifically a Culex pipiens mosquito. One in five infected people with WNV would experience fever, nausea, headache and muscle aches lasting from a few days to a few weeks - while the remaining four out of five would not exhibit any symptoms. To date, the virus remains a major concern as individuals with weaker immune systems and those above 60 are at higher risk for severe illness from WNV - raking up medical costs and creating more burden in the healthcare system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every year the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) runs a comprehensive surveillance program in suburban areas to trap mosquitoes and test them for WNV. This data has helped CDPH target high-risk areas for the virus and significantly reduce the number of positive cases in the last few years. ([source](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/statistics_and_reports/CDInfo_2013_JULY_WNV.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "However in 2021, Chicago was ranked one of the top five US cities with mosquitoes - putting its residents at risk of contracting WNV. ([source](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-to-spray-insecticide-to-protect-against-west-nile-virus)). Furthermore in the last two years, much of the public efforts and funding were focused on keeping the city safe from COVID-19. Now, ahead of the looming recession and tightening of budgets ([source](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023)), the CDPH recognized an urgency to plan ahead and be prudent about spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our team at the Disease and Treatment Agency was tasked to analyze the years with more severe WNV outbreak and devise a plan to identify potential hotspots, ahead of the 2023 summer period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "To build a model with more than **70% recall** to predict the period and location where mosquitoes will test positive for WNV, enabling CDPH to preemptively allocate the city’s spraying resources to curb the virus transmission."

    "- [`train.csv`](../assets/train.csv): This is the main dataset we'll be working with, which contains 10,506 observations on the presence of West Nile Virus across neighborhood clusters in Chicago, Illinois. This dataset is taken from the years 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. There are a total of 11 variables involved in tracking the West Nile Virus in the neighborhoods.\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we've conducted a thorough analysis and modeling through these steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: We assessed the training dataset for any outliers and removed them immediately. We also checked for missing values where we've filled them or removed them if irrelevant.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We visualized the dataset through a series of graphs and plots to better understand the relationships between variables as well as its individual impact the spread of the West Nile Virus.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**: After evaluating specific variables, we removed variables that didn't have much impact and combined variables that were relevant to each other.\n",
    "4. **Data Modeling & Evaluation**: Based on the selected features, we modeled them through these classification models - Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier and Adaptive Boosting Classifier. The best model will then be used to predict the presence of West Nile Virus in the test dataset. \n",
    "5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Following the best model selected, we also conducted a cost-benefit analysis on annual cost of pesticide coverage and its benefits - particularly for areas that are at higher risk.\n",
