    "In 2022, Chicago reported one human case of West Nile virus (WNV) towards the end of the summer and early fall season. This is remarkable compared to the previous 13 reported cases in the previous year, and even more in the years before. \n",
    "\n",
    "WNV is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US, and it is spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, specifically a Culex pipiens mosquito. One in five infected people with WNV would experience fever, nausea, headache and muscle aches lasting from a few days to a few weeks - while the remaining four out of five would not exhibit any symptoms. However the virus remains a major concern as individuals with weaker immune systems and those above 60 are at higher risk for severe illness from WNV. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every year the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) runs a comprehensive surveillance program in suburban areas to trap mosquitoes and test them for WNV. This data has helped CDPH target high-risk areas for the virus and significantly reduce the number of positive cases in the last few years. ([source](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/healthy_communities/news/2022/september/first-human-case-of-west-nile-virus-detected-in-chicago-in-2022.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "However the CDPH recognized that the last few years of data have major anomalies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and low infection count, hence we may not be able to use recent data to create an action plan for 2023. Our team at the Disease and Treatment Agency was tasked to analyze the years with more severe WNV outbreak and devise a plan to minimize the spread of the WNV. Through the historical data from the WNV surveillance reports coupled with weather information and pesticide usage,\n",
    "1. We used machine learning models to predict when and where the mosquitoes will test positive for WNV.\n",
    "2. The best model allowed us to predict WNV outbreaks as accurately as possible so that we can effectively allocate resources to curb the virus transmission.\n"

    "- [`train.csv`](../assets/train.csv): This is the main dataset we'll be working with, which contains 10,506 observations on the presence of West Nile Virus across neighborhood clusters in Chicago, Illinois. This dataset is taken from the years 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. There are a total of 11 variables involved in tracking the West Nile Virus in the neighborhoods.\n",
    "- [`test.csv`](../assets/test.csv): There's a total of 11 features and 116,293 observations for the years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. The presence of West Nile Virus is missing from this set, which we will use our model to predict. \n",
    "- [`spray.csv`](../assets/spray.csv): This dataset contains 14,835 geographic information system (GIS) data on the city's spraying efforts in 2011 and 2013 - including the date, time, latitude and longitude.\n",
    "-  [`weather.csv`](../assets/weather.csv): This dataset contains weather information from 2007 to 2014 - covering 2,944 observations across 22 relevant weather-related variables. \n",
    "- [`mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.txt`](../assets/mapdata_copyright_openstreetmap_contributors.txt): Map files from Open Streetmap and used for visualizations in the analysis. "

    "\n",
    "For this project, we've conducted a thorough analysis and modeling through these steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: We assessed the training dataset for any outliers and removed them immediately. We also checked for missing values where we've filled them or removed them if irrelevant.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We visualized the dataset through a series of graphs and plots to better understand the relationships between variables as well as its individual impact the spread of the West Nile Virus.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**: After evaluating specific variables, we removed variables that didn't have much impact and combined variables that were relevant to each other.\n",
    "4. **Data Modeling & Evaluation**: Based on the selected features, we modeled them through these classification models - **XXX**. The best model will then be used to predict the presence of West Nile Virus in the test dataset. \n",
    "5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Following the best model selected, we also conducted a cost-benefit analysis on annual cost of pesticide coverage and its benefits - particularly for areas that are at higher risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also uploaded the predicted West Nile Virus presence on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-west-nile-virus/data) to measure the accuracy of our finalized model."
